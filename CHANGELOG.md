# Changelog

All notable changes to Waydir will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Center shortcut bar: new "Quick Look" button (first position, fileTxt icon) that opens the quick preview for the selected file, completing the TC F3-equivalent action set in the bar.
- TC-style quick view panel (Ctrl+Q): a persistent preview strip at the bottom of the opposite pane that follows the cursor in the active pane, reusing the Quick Look renderers (image / pdf / markdown / code / properties).
- Pause/resume for queued file operations (TC queue parity): queued tasks can be paused and resumed from the operations panel.
- Checksum manifest files: create `.md5` / `.sha256` manifests for selected files (GNU coreutils format, one per folder), and verify an existing manifest in batch with a per-file result list.
- Split/combine files (TC parity): split a file into numbered parts (`.001`, `.002`, …) with a `.crc` MD5 manifest, and combine parts back via the context menu. Preset sizes (floppy / 100 MB / CD / DVD) plus custom byte size.
- Automatic conflict policies (TC parity): settings to auto-overwrite when the source is newer (skip when older) and to auto-skip files with identical sizes during copy. Runtime-only for now (DB persistence deferred until codegen is available locally).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Vertical center shortcut bar between the two panes in dual-pane mode (new file, new folder, copy/move to other pane, delete, tree/list/grid view, select/deselect by pattern, invert selection, search, sync, multi rename, toggle hidden, properties).
- "New File" support: `startCreate` can now create an empty file (local and SFTP).
- "Deselect by pattern" support for un-selecting a group of files by glob.

### Changed
- The app is now permanently in dual-pane mode; the single-pane layout and the toggle entry (menu / shortcut / command palette) were removed.
- Horizontal shortcut bar (title bar) trimmed: removed back/forward/up/refresh/new folder/copy/cut/paste/delete/properties buttons; the center shortcut bar now hosts these actions.
- Dialog primary buttons (hidden list "Add", shortcut bar "Add") now use the same muted styling as the other buttons.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Hidden list (`隐藏文件.ini`): hide selected files and folders from every list view via the right-click menu, with an editable hidden list dialog under the View menu.
- Single-instance enforcement: launching the app again focuses the existing window instead of starting a second copy.
- Open maximized by default on startup.

### Changed
- Renamed the application to **MyExplorer** (window title, executable name, installer and product metadata).

## [0.50.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- Total Commander-style shortcut bar: import `.bar` button bars (UTF-8 and GBK), app icons from `path,index` specs or embedded exe/dll icons, separators, `CD <path>` folder navigation and `cm_` built-in commands (`cm_OpenDesktop`, `cm_OpenRecycled`, `cm_OpenDrives`).
- Simplified Chinese localization, auto-detected on Chinese systems.
- Optional icon field when adding shortcut bar items.

### Changed
- Windows-only: Linux and macOS support, directories, CI jobs and platform-specific code removed.
- CI rebuilt around `windows-latest` runners; the Rust core is built and vendored in the pipeline.
- Integration tests no longer require a live SMB server (live cases are gated behind the `WAYDIR_LIVE_SMB` compile-time flag and skipped by default).
- `sqlite3` pinned to 3.1.7 to avoid the native-assets build hook.

### Fixed
- Integration tests hanging on CI when no SMB server is present.
- Integration tests on Windows runners.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Tree view for browsing folders inline from the file list.

### Fixed
- Grid navigation in Quick Look.
- Cmd+W can close the last macOS window.
- Extracted files keep their original modified dates.
- Delete operation edge cases and safe file replace.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Duplicate selected files and folders in place with `Ctrl+Shift+D`, available from the keyboard, command palette and context menu.

### Changed
- Faster file copying, especially on Windows and when copying lots of small files.
- Renamed the "Kind" column to "Format".

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Command palette (`Ctrl+P`) to fuzzy-search and run actions, jump to bookmarks, drives, recent locations and files, and run plugin actions.

### Changed
- Removed the toast notification shown when a new version is available.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Settings dialogs no longer fail to render their modals.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Plugins: actions can read the other pane through `ctx.other_pane` and every pane through `ctx.panes`, enabling copy-to-other-pane, compare and sync workflows.
- Plugins: reactive `navigate` and `selection_change` event handlers via the `event` field.
- Folder compare and sync between panes.
- Color tags for files, with a sidebar section and filtering.
- Setting to make dragging move files by default (Alt copies). ([#184](https://github.com/Waydir/Waydir/issues/184))
- Menu bar: dedicated Help menu with in-app tutorial, keybindings, diagnostics, repository and bug report links.
- Preferences: in-dialog search to jump to any setting.

### Changed
- Reworked the Help dialog.
- Plugins now run with full trust: the `exec`/`fs` permission system was removed. Existing plugins keep working; any `permissions` field in a manifest is ignored.
- Plugins load and status bars refresh on a shared background isolate instead of spawning one per call, keeping startup and panes smooth.

### Fixed
- `waydir.exec` is now bounded to 5 seconds, so a hung external command can no longer wedge a plugin.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- Quick Look: Markdown preview for `.md` and `.markdown` files.
- More shortcuts are now customizable: Delete, Rename, New Folder, and dual-pane Copy/Move.
- Customizable shortcut for permanent delete (defaults to `Ctrl+Delete`), now separate from move-to-trash.
- Resizable columns in the file list (toggle in Appearance).
- Collapsible sidebar sections.
- Terminal: configurable copy/paste modifier (Standard `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V` vs. `Ctrl+Shift+C`/`Ctrl+Shift+V`, platform-aware default) in Terminal preferences.

### Fixed
- Renaming the same item repeatedly no longer loses focus.
- Spacing between list view columns cleaned up.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- macOS: "Date added" column showing when a file appeared in its current folder. ([#173](https://github.com/Waydir/Waydir/issues/173)) ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))
- macOS: closing the window now keeps the app in the dock instead of quitting, and reopening it (dock click or Cmd+N) brings the window back. ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))
- Windows: WSL support. Browse WSL distributions from the sidebar.
- Terminal: the new-tab dropdown lets you pick any shell, or a WSL distribution, to launch the next terminal session.
- Terminal: Ctrl+Enter inserts relative paths and Ctrl+Shift+Enter inserts absolute paths for the current file selection.
- Menu bar: View menu now marks the active layout (list/grid), and a new Terminal menu toggles the panel and manages terminal tabs.
- Selection: Invert selection (`Ctrl+I`).
- Navigation: `Home`/`End` jump to the first/last item (Shift extends the selection).
- Calculate folder sizes (`Alt+S`); sizes show live in the Size column and sort with it.

### Fixed
- "Show folders before files" preference now applies; removed the duplicate toggle from the sort menu.
- Sort by size now treats folders as size 0 and keeps them name-ascending, instead of using the directory inode size.
- PDF preview crash when rapidly switching between files ([#175](https://github.com/Waydir/Waydir/issues/175)).
- "Date created" now uses real birth time instead of ctime ([#174](https://github.com/Waydir/Waydir/issues/174)).
- File operations now report a clean "Permission denied" message (instead of a raw error string) across more cases, including SFTP/SMB transfers and Windows access-denied errors.
- Quick Look: line numbers now have more room before the editor content.
- Insert now starts keyboard selection from the current file instead of clearing it on the first press.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Quick Look: PDF preview.
- Sort menu (status bar button and right-click), so sorting works in grid view too.
- Appearance: "Show folders before files" toggle.
- Type-ahead jump: quickly typed letters combine into a search string (toggle in General settings).
- Jump to bookmarks with Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+1..9.

### Fixed

- Updates now verify downloaded files before installing.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Grid view with image thumbnails.
- Search now has a Filter mode with query suggestions for kind, extension, size, date and hidden-file filters.
- Quick Look: prompts to save, discard or cancel when closing the editor with unsaved changes.
- Quick Look: relative line numbers option, showing distance from the current line.
- Quick Look: option to turn off the statistics panel for multi-selection properties.
- The path bar now expands environment variables: `%VAR%` on Windows and `$VAR`/`${VAR}` on Linux and macOS. ([#163](https://github.com/Waydir/Waydir/issues/163))
- Command-line support: launch Waydir with folder paths and options to open straight to a location. Run `waydir --help` for details. ([#164](https://github.com/Waydir/Waydir/issues/164))

### Changed
- The file list now shows descriptive Kind labels by default, with the default column order set to Name, Kind, Size, then Date.
- Quick Look editor now uses a viewport-virtualized engine (re_editor), so editing stays fast even on very large files.
- Quick Look now previews text files up to 32 MB (was 4 MB); syntax highlighting is skipped above 1 MB to keep large files instant.
- The changelog viewer now shows only released versions with cleaner headings.
- Quick Look now shows a Created date and formats dates using your date-format preference.

### Fixed
- Terminal: text lines no longer bleed above the panel into the widgets above it.
- Terminal: Alt+letter shortcuts now send the lowercase key (for example Alt+v sends `ESC v`), so meta keybindings work.
- Terminal: Ctrl+V now passes through to the running app when the clipboard holds an image, so it can handle the image paste itself.
- Quick Look: Ctrl+S (Cmd+S) now saves edits in the editor.
- Quick Look: the line-number gutter now always widens to fit the longest number.
- Quick Look: line numbers now align with their lines on Windows.
- Windows: the Permissions and Owner columns and the Quick Look permissions row, which are POSIX-only, are no longer shown.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Changelog viewer: open it from the Waydir menu to read all release notes rendered as Markdown.
- Quick Look preferences: choose the editor font and line height, show line numbers, toggle line wrapping and enable a basic Vim mode for editing previews.
- File list columns can be configured: toggle Size, Date modified, Kind, Date created, Permissions and Owner on or off, and drag to reorder them. Every column is sortable.
- The path bar now expands `~` to the home folder. ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))
- macOS: Waydir now prompts for Full Disk Access when needed. ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))

### Fixed
- Copying, pasting and dragging files into an empty folder now works. ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))
- macOS: the Videos location now opens the Movies folder. ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))
- macOS: files copied in Finder can now be pasted in Waydir, and Waydir's own copies are recognized by Finder. ([@fwitkowski17](https://github.com/fwitkowski17))

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Sidebar edit mode: reorder sections and items by dragging, and hide ones you don't use. Every item now has a right-click menu (open, copy path, properties, eject, and more).
- File and terminal tabs can now be reordered by dragging.
- One Dark is now available as a built-in theme.

### Changed
- Reworked sidebar spacing for consistent alignment, and renamed the Favorites section to Places.
- Multi Rename now appears in Operations with progress while files are being renamed.

### Fixed
- Operation cancellation no longer gets stuck in the cancelling state.
- Terminal text selection now auto-scrolls and keeps the selected range correct.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE package repositories: install Waydir from an apt or dnf/zypper repository and receive new releases through your regular package manager updates.

### Changed
- deb and rpm builds no longer install updates from within the app. When Waydir runs from a package, the updater now points you to your package manager (`apt upgrade` / `dnf upgrade`), which the repository keeps up to date.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Quick Look shortcuts now have their own section in the keyboard shortcuts, and a hint bar at the bottom of the Quick Look window shows the available keys. The close key can be remapped (defaults to Space).
- Plugins can register global and per-pane status bars with periodically refreshed text, badges, icons and buttons.

### Fixed
- Quick Look: arrow keys keep moving between files even when an editable file is open; Ctrl/⌥ + arrows switch files while editing.
- The rename shortcut now starts multi-rename when several files are selected.
- A failing plugin action now shows an error notification instead of crashing the app.
- Plugin enable/disable state now updates immediately in Preferences.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Plugin `run_task` can show long-running external commands in Operations with optional regex-based progress parsing.
- Plugins can query local file sizes with `waydir.file_size`.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Plugins: `waydir.exec` now returns the command's stdout, stderr, and exit code.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Windows: entering a bare server (`\\computername`) now lists its shared folders, the way Explorer does.
- Confirm button in the editable path bar.
- Plugin system: extend Waydir with small Lua plugins that add context-menu, menu bar, toolbar, and keyboard-shortcut actions. Manage and configure them in Preferences → Plugins. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) for the guide and example plugins.
- Preferences option to sort only files and keep folders in their default order.

### Fixed
- SMB: listing a host's shares now prompts for a password when one is required.
- Restoring a session no longer hangs on startup when the last folder was a network path; on any restore failure Waydir falls back to the home folder and logs the error.
- Cancel now stops a copy or move immediately during scanning.
- Sidebar scrollbar no longer overlaps the resize edge, so both are easy to grab.
- Root path `/` now shows in the path bar.
- macOS: files and folders now show up reliably (the native core is shipped as a universal binary).
- macOS: drive size and usage in tooltips are no longer doubled.
- Linux: the AppImage now uses a gzip-compressed squashfs and a statically linked runtime, so it runs on older squashfuse / AppImageLauncher and on fuse3-only systems without libfuse2.

### Changed
- Windows: drive names now read `Local Disk (C:)`, and network drives show the share name like `share (Z:)`.
- Shortcuts modal grouped into clearer categories (separate View, Terminal, and General sections).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- macOS: menus moved to the native menu bar.

### Fixed
- AppImage now links to the download instead of failing an in-place update.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- The sidebar can be resized by dragging its edge, and collapses to an icon-only rail when narrowed past a threshold; the width is remembered.
- Linux builds are now also published as an AppImage (portable, no install).
- Page Up / Page Down move the cursor by a page in the file list (Shift extends the selection).
- Shell selection for the built-in terminal.
- "Open in Terminal" lists the external terminals detected on the system instead of only auto-detect.

### Changed
- "Open in Terminal" now opens the built-in terminal by default; the external terminal stays available in Preferences.

### Fixed
- Windows network breadcrumbs split the server and share, so you can click the server to browse its shares.
- Shift + arrow keys now extend the selection in the file list.
- Terminal tabs and the new-tab/close buttons now show hover feedback.
- Resizing the terminal panel is now smooth (the drag no longer rebuilds the whole pane on every frame).
- The split between dual panes is easier to grab (wider, reliable drag target).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Natural sort order (enabled by default): numbers in file names sort by value, so "file2" comes before "file10". Can be toggled in Preferences → Appearance.
- Sidebar network entries now show a tooltip with the full name (and remote target) when the label is truncated.

### Fixed
- New folders no longer briefly appear twice before a refresh.
- After creating a folder you can open it with Enter right away, without clicking the list first.
- Windows network drives now show the drive letter first in the label.
- Windows: listing a bare network share root (`\\server\share`) now works.

- Connect to network drives over SMB and SFTP from the sidebar's Network section. Browse, open, copy, move, and delete remote files like local ones.

### Changed
